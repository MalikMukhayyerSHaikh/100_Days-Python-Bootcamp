# 🐍 100 Days of Python Bootcamp

Welcome to the **100 Days of Python Bootcamp**! 🚀 This repository is dedicated to documenting my daily progress as I learn and master Python through a series of hands-on projects and exercises. Each day covers new Python concepts, ranging from beginner-level basics to advanced programming techniques. The aim is to build real-world projects while deepening my Python knowledge step by step.
## 📅 Overview

This bootcamp is structured to focus on **one project or concept** every day for 100 days. The journey will cover:

- 🧠 **Day 1-20:** Python Basics (Variables, Data Types, Operators, Control Flow)
- 🛠️ **Day 21-40:** Intermediate Concepts (Functions, Modules, File Handling, OOP)
- 📊 **Day 41-60:** Data Structures and Algorithms (Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets, Sorting & Searching)
- 🤖 **Day 61-80:** Advanced Topics (Decorators, Generators, Regular Expressions, Error Handling)
- 📈 **Day 81-100:** Projects & Libraries (Data Science, Web Development, Automation)

Each day's content will include:
- A new **project or exercise** related to that day's learning.
- Explanations and notes on Python concepts.
- Solutions and walkthroughs for any challenges encountered.



## 🚀 Goals & Learning Objectives

- Master Python syntax and core programming concepts.
- Build real-world applications using Python.
- Learn and apply best coding practices.
- Get familiar with popular Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Flask, Django).
- Enhance problem-solving skills through algorithmic challenges.



## 📝 How to Use This Repository

1. **Daily Progress:** Each day's project or learning will be in a separate folder named `DayXX_ProjectName`. Inside each folder, you'll find:
    - **Main code file**: `.py` or Jupyter Notebook with code.
    - **README**: A short description of the project and how to run it.
    - **Notes**: Key Python concepts learned during the day.
  
2. **Clone the Repo:** 
   
   git clone https://github.com/MalikMukhayyerSHaikh/100_Days-Python-Bootcamp.git
   

3. **Follow Along:** You can follow along and try the projects yourself!



## 🧑‍💻 Requirements

To follow along with this bootcamp, you'll need:
- **Python 3.8+** installed
- Recommended: Use a **virtual environment** for each project.
- Common Python libraries: `requests`, `flask`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, etc.
